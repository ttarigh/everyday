      "generatedPrompt": "** A realistic portrait of a [person's assumed gender and ethnicity], late 20s/early 30s, outdoors in late November/early December 2025. The person is wearing a slightly worn, comfortable-looking cable knit sweater in a neutral color, and dark wash jeans. They are holding a reusable coffee cup and smiling gently at something just out of frame. The lighting is soft, slightly overcast winter light. There are subtle signs of aging: very faint smile lines deepening slightly around the eyes, a touch more definition under the cheekbones, and slightly less shine to the skin. The hair is styled similarly to the original photo (assume a relatively low-maintenance style), but perhaps a shade less vibrant, with a few stray strands. The overall impression is natural and subtly aged. Emphasis should be on realistic skin texture and lighting, with no dramatic changes. The background is a blurred city park with bare trees.\n\n**CAPTION:** Crisp morning walks and cozy sweaters. Embracing these late autumn days! ☕🍂 #sweaterweather #autumnvibes #dailywalk #happy",

They are in a brightly lit, modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances and a large window overlooking a cityscape that suggests a location far from New York, perhaps San Francisco or Seattle. They are wearing comfortable, slightly wrinkled travel clothes – a dark grey hoodie, leggings, and fuzzy socks. Their hair is slightly messy and pulled back into a loose bun, revealing dark circles under their eyes suggesting jet lag. In their hand, they hold a steaming mug of coffee, and a half-eaten avocado toast sits on the counter beside them. The overall expression is tired but content, with a hint of a smile. The background shows unpacked luggage near the window.",

Jet lag is subtly visible: slightly tired eyes, but energized by the new location. They are wearing comfortable but stylish travel clothes – perhaps linen pants and a lightweight, breathable shirt with a small, colorful backpack slung over one shoulder. Their hair is slightly tousled, a testament to the long flight and early morning. They are holding a small paper fortune (omikuji) in one hand, a slightly puzzled but happy expression on their face as they try to decipher it. The background is slightly blurred to emphasize the subject and the vibrant gate. The lighting is soft morning light, highlighting the reds and oranges of the shrine.",
